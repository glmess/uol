## Research context

Microservices are architecture style for building applications that has grown in popularity as many organizations are moving away from the tradional approach of building, deploying and maintaining applications as a single entity also known as monilithic applications. This perhaps explains why the amount of research on microservices has also increased in the past four to five years. With the amount of knowledge such research has and is continuing to generate, it opens up opportunities for researchers to conduct systematic litterature surveys with the aim to finding answers to questions that stemmed from current knowledge gap on microservices paradigm. One such gap that exists is the lack of a taxonomy for defining, classifying and selecting microservices for building application to fufill given end-users requirements. 

This research aims to producing such taxonomy. To do so will require answering a number research questions outlined in the next section.


## Research questions

This study will attempt to answer the following research questions.

**RQ1**: What defines a microservice and what are the properties of microservices?

**RQ2**: What are the existing processes, tools, techniques and frameworks that are used to design microservices?

**RQ3**: What are the techniques for building microservice-based applications and what are their advantages and disadvantages?

**RQ4**: What are the criteria in respect to end-user requirements for selecting microservices when building a microservice-based application?

The table below outlines the RQs and the motivation for seeking answer to each in respect to the study.

| What are the techniques for building microservice-based applications and what are their advantages and disadvantages?                 | The aim is to investigate what are the drivers, techniques, for building application using microservices as building blocks                                                                   |
| What are the criteria in respect to end-user requirements for selecting microservices when building a microservice-based application? | The aim is to understand on what basis a microservice is deemed to be most suitable than the other for a particular application given a specific set of requirements.                         |

The research questions are defined in such a way that there is clear relationship between them a logical flow with the answer to each research question setting us well for answering the next one and a step forward towards the end product of the overall research. 

## Significance of the research

The goal of this study is to add to the body of research knowkedge on microservices. One specific area where this research could make a difference is by producing a taxonomy that will guidance for practitioners as they look for better ways to adopt microservices and get value from it. 

Another reason why this research is important is the opportunity for it to contribute towards my PhD research which aims to propose a novel approach to building applications by way of automated composition of microservices. The output of the literature survey will serve as building block for constructing the new approach to microservice composition. 

## Research approach

I will conduct a qualitative research by looking into existing literature on microservices and try to uncover facts that will help answer the set research questions. I will follow the guidelines of systematic literature survey for retrieving and selecting papers of interest from the most popular databases such as Scopus,Google scholar, Science Direct and SpringerLink. 

The retrieval process will be done by clearly defined queries oulined in the next section, while the selection process will be done on the basis of defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of which can be found in the corresponding section below. 

The goal of this exercise will be to end up with a refined list of papers that are most relevant to my research upon applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. I will then take that list read the papers and do some coding of the key concepts, therories or patterns, that will help answer my research questions. I will then report the results and discuss my findings. 

## Keywords and search strings

I intend to use the following search keywords to form my search queries:

**Keywords & Synonymous**
