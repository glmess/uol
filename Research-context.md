## Research context

Microservices are architecture style for building applications that has grown in popularity as many organizations are moving away from the tradional approach of building, deploying and maintaining applications as a single entity also known as monilithic applications. This perhaps explains why the amount of research on microservices has also increased in the past four to five years. With the amount of knowledge such research has and is continuing to generate, it opens up opportunities for researchers to conduct systematic litterature surveys with the aim to finding answers to questions that stemmed from current knowledge gap on microservices paradigm. One such gap that exists is the lack of a taxonomy for defining, classifying and selecting microservices for building application to fufill given end-users requirements. 

This research aims to producing such taxonomy. To do so will require answering a number research questions outlined in the next section.


## Research questions
This study will attempt to answer the following research questions

**RQ1**: What defines a microservice and what are the properties of microservices?

**Motivation**: The aim is understand what makes an entity a microservice and what are the properties (technical and functional) of microservices.

**RQ2**: What are the existing processes, tools, techniques and frameworks that are used to design microservices?

**Motivation**: The aim is to understand how microservices are built, what are their commonalities and what differentiate them from one another, as well as the complexities involved in their design process


**RQ3**: What are the techniques for building microservice-based applications and what are their advantages and disadvantages.

**Motivation**: The aim is to investigate what are the drivers, techniques, to build application using microservices as building blocks

**RQ4**: What are the criteria in respect to end-user requirements for selecting microservices when building a microservice-based application?

**Motivation**: The aim is to understand on what basis a microservice is deemed to be most suitable than the other for a particular application given a specific set of requirements.
