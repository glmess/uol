## What would be the novelty of your review compared to Francesco and Lago? do they answer drastically different questions?

The commonality between Francesco and Lago work and my research is that they both focus on microservices architectures. However, we are both looking at it from totally different angles and as such significantly answering different questions.

Francesco and Lago goal is to understand the current publication trends of research on architecting with microservices whihout necessarily looking into the details on the different architecting approaches. 

For instance their study reports that 19 papers on microservice composition have been published without diving deep into the approaches used in those papers which one thing I am looking to do in my research.
Also, they also focus on potential for industrial adoption of existing research on architecting with microservices which is not a path that I intend to follow.

Last but not least they propose a classification framework for microservice architecture which again drastically differ from my goal which is to propose a novel approach to microservice composition.

## How I intend to address RQ4?

This is where I intend to propose a new approach to microservices composition which is the main topic of my PhD. I will basically compare and contrast existing approaches and come up with a new approach that combines strengths of existing ones or with completely new features. What I'm still not sure about is whether this should be part of the literature survey or whether it would be best answered at a later stage after I have done the mining of sample microservices applications to identify patterns. Will definetely need you guidance here.
